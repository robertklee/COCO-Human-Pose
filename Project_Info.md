# Human Pose Estimator

Human pose estimation (HPE) is the problem domain of identifying body keypoints to construct a body model. 
The application of HPE is widespread and benefits many industries. In particular, HPE is used for animation in both the film and gaming industries. 
Another subset of HPE is hand pose estimation which can be used to translate sign language.
