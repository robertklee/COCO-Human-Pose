% README: To avoid duplicate entries, please use the following naming convention:
% - primary author's last/family name, year, and starting page
% - sort my entries by year

% Reasoning below:
% The key, is to have a consistent scheme for generating the key that is derived from the entry's info and guaranteed to be unique. This way, when someone goes to add a new entry, they can easily search for what the key should be to see if it already exists.

% Additionally, I sort my entries by year (something I just started doing, actually) and within that by primary author's last/family name. This also makes it exceedingly easy to figure out if I already have the key and entry in the database.
